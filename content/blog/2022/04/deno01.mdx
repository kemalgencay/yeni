Past three years taught me what NOT to do: no more React, no more Nodejs. As of today
I start experimenting whith Deno, together whith GraphQL and what comes along that line.
I continue whith Gatsby whithout messing whith modules etc., just for presentation like this post.
So here are my ToDo links for the coming weeks:

Take care and bye for a while
